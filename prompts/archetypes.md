## ⚖️ Balance

**Objective**: Versatility and Consistency

The Balance archetype seeks stability and the ability to handle almost any threat. It is the middle ground between defense and offense.

**Typical Composition**: A healthy mix of 2-3 Walls (physical and special), 1-2 Utility Pivots, 1 Cleric or Support, and 1-2 Sweepers or Wallbreakers.

**Playstyle**: Based on gradually wearing down the opponent while maintaining the health of its own Pokémon. Uses Pivots to gain momentum and bring in attackers at the opportune moment.

**Strengths**: Very adaptable. Can handle both fast offensive teams (Offense) and slow defensive teams (Stall) effectively.

**Weaknesses**: May lack the brute force to break through extreme Walls or the speed to stop a well-executed Hyper Offense.

## 💥 Offense

**Objective**: Pressure, Pressure, Pressure

Offense focuses on overwhelming the opponent with constant damage and quick KOs.

**Typical Composition**: Few or no Walls. High number of Wallbreakers, Sweepers (often with Choice Items), 1 aggressive Hazard Setter, and often a Revenge Killer.

**Playstyle**: Seeks to establish hazards quickly and then have attackers enter and eliminate threats before the opponent can respond. The game is often decided in the first few turns.

**Strengths**: Capable of generating an enormous amount of damage and pressuring the opponent, finishing games very quickly.

**Weaknesses**: Very susceptible to passive damage from its own entry hazards and can be stopped if its main Sweeper is neutralized or defeated.

## 🛡️ Bulky Offense

**Objective**: Attack with Resistance

An evolution of Offense that incorporates bulk to ensure that attackers can take a hit and return damage.

**Typical Composition**: Wallbreakers and Sweepers that have decent defensive stats (bulk). Includes very bulky Utility Pivots and Walls with offensive capability (e.g., Utility Walls with status moves).

**Playstyle**: Attacks more slowly than pure Offense. The team can trade hits without falling immediately, which gives more opportunities to predict and set up.

**Strengths**: High damage output combined with longevity. Less vulnerable to Revenge Killers and entry pressure.

**Weaknesses**: Slower than pure Offense. Can still be worn down by dedicated Stall teams if it doesn't have a strong Wallbreaker.

## 🐢 Stall / Defense

**Objective**: Wear Down and Survive

The Stall archetype's main objective is to outlast the opponent through recovery, status denial, and passive damage.

**Typical Composition**: Most are dedicated Walls (Physical, Special, and Mixed), Clerics, Phazers, and Hazard Removers/Setters (who use Toxic Spikes or Spikes).

**Playstyle**: Minimizes the opponent's attacking opportunities using status moves (Toxic), Phazing to accumulate hazard damage, and constantly healing. They seek to nullify the opposing Sweeper at all costs.

**Strengths**: Extremely difficult to break if played correctly. Neutralizes many common attackers.

**Weaknesses**: Very passive and predictable. Very vulnerable to Wallbreakers or Trappers that can eliminate key Walls. Mistakes in gameplay are heavily penalized.

## 🚀 Hyper Offense

**Objective**: Maximum Attack Speed

An extreme version of Offense. Prioritizes damage at maximum speed, often using one-time support mechanisms.

**Typical Composition**: Several Sweepers that require setup. Uses Screen Setters (Reflect/Light Screen) or Pokémon with Focus Sash or Custap Berry to guarantee the setup of a key attacker.

**Playstyle**: The first Pokémon sets up Screens or Hazards, then the main attacker enters and uses setup behind the protection. The goal is to achieve the sweep before the Screens or Hazards wear off.

**Strengths**: Unstoppable if it achieves setup. Capable of defeating Stall and Balance teams that aren't prepared.

**Weaknesses**: Extreme dependence on the main Pokémon. If the setup fails or the Sweeper falls, the team often crumbles. Very vulnerable to Taunt and Phazing.

## 🌪️ Specialty Teams

**Objective**: Exploit a Specific Mechanic

These teams are built around a field move or condition that benefits all its members.

**Weather/Terrain Teams**: Built around weather conditions like Rain Dance, Sunny Day, or terrain effects like Electric Terrain. The team is composed of Pokémon with abilities that activate with the weather/terrain (e.g., Swift Swim in Rain) or that use boosted moves.

**Trick Room Teams**: The team only uses very slow Pokémon (low base Speed and Speed IVs at 0) so they become the fastest while Trick Room is active.

**Baton Pass Teams**: A Pokémon sets up many stat boosts and then uses Baton Pass to transfer all the increases to a Sweeper that becomes invincible. Generally heavily restricted or banned in most formats.
