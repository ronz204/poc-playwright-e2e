## ⚔️ Offensive Roles

**Sweeper (Setup Sweeper)**: Pokémon whose main objective is to win the battle in the late game. They use stat-boosting moves like Swords Dance, Nasty Plot, or Dragon Dance, and then attack to "sweep" through the enemy team by defeating multiple Pokémon in succession.

**Revenge Killer**: Pokémon with exceptionally high speed or that use priority moves. Their job is to enter after a teammate has fallen and quickly defeat the opposing Pokémon to regain momentum in the battle.

**Wallbreaker**: Pokémon with brutal offensive power designed to overwhelm and defeat enemy Walls. They enter and hit hard without needing any setup moves.

**Mixed Attacker**: A Pokémon that uses both Physical and Special attacks. This makes it difficult for the opponent to decide which defensive Wall to use.

**Stopper (Anti-Setup)**: Generally a Pokémon with Taunt or a combination of Phazing and high offensive power to prevent opposing Sweepers from boosting their stats.

**Late-Game Cleaner**: A Sweeper reserved specifically for the end of the battle, once the main defensive threats have been weakened or eliminated.

**Choice Locker**: An attacker holding a Choice item (*Choice Band*, *Choice Specs*, *Choice Scarf*). This role maximizes damage output or speed, but restricts the user to a single move until they switch out. Crucial for immediate pressure.

## 🛡️ Defensive Roles

**Wall**: Pokémon with exceptionally high defensive stats. Their main objective is to take hits of a specific type (Physical or Special), force switches, and use recovery or status moves. They are the foundation of team stability.

**Phazer**: Their function is to force the opponent to switch Pokémon. They use moves like Roar, Whirlwind, or Dragon Tail to nullify Pokémon attempting to boost their stats (setup sweepers) or simply to wear down the opposing team with hazard damage.

**Hazard Setter**: Pokémon that typically come out at the start of battle to set entry hazards as soon as possible (such as Stealth Rock, Spikes, or Toxic Spikes). They often carry Taunt to prevent the opponent from doing the same.

**Hazard Remover**: Their role is to remove entry hazards placed by the opponent. They use moves like Rapid Spin or Defog to protect their team from passive damage.

**Trapper**: Pokémon with abilities (like Shadow Tag or Arena Trap) or moves (Mean Look, Block) that prevent the opponent from switching Pokémon. They are used to eliminate specific threats or weakened Pokémon.

**Status Absorber**: Pokémon that absorb dangerous status conditions or take advantage of them, or simply have enough HP and balanced defenses to withstand many types of attacks.

**Flickering** A defensive Pokémon whose primary use is to absorb a powerful attack and then use a utility move like Parting Shot or Memento before fainting, ensuring a safe switch-in for a major threat.

## 💊 Support Roles

**Cleric**: Pokémon that specialize in healing or helping their teammates. They use moves like Wish, Heal Bell, or Aromatherapy to remove status problems or recover HP, keeping the team healthy.

**Pivot (Utility Pivot)**: Pokémon that enter and exit battle repeatedly to maintain momentum or use support moves. They utilize U-turn, Volt Switch, or Flip Turn to slightly damage the opponent while returning to their Pokéball, bringing the most advantageous Pokémon to the field.

**Screen Setter**: Pokémon that set up protective barriers, usually *Light Screen* and *Reflect*, to reduce damage for the entire team for several turns, enabling setup sweepers to enter safely.

## ⚡ Speed Control Roles

**Trick Room Setter**: Pokémon that use the move Trick Room to invert speed. The team is composed of very slow Pokémon that become the fastest under this effect.

**Weather Setter**: Pokémon that use moves or abilities to change the weather and benefit their teammates (e.g., increasing damage of certain attacks or the speed of specific Pokémon).

**Tailwind Setter**: Common in Double Battle format. Uses the move Tailwind to double the speed of the entire team for a few turns.
