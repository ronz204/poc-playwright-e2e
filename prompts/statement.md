**📑 Pokédex & Data Viewer**

A comprehensive data exploration module that enables users to search, filter, and visualize detailed information for any Pokémon available through the PokéAPI. This module provides access to essential competitive data including base statistics, complete movesets, abilities, type matchups, and evolutionary chains. 

A standout feature is the interactive Type Effectiveness chart that displays offensive and defensive type matchups for the selected Pokémon. This serves as the foundational reference tool for competitive analysis, allowing players to instantly assess type advantages, resistances, and vulnerabilities. Quick access to raw statistical data (such as base stats, ability effects, and move details) empowers players to make informed strategic decisions during team building and battle planning.

**🛠️ Team Builder & Persistence**

A robust team management system that allows authenticated users to construct, save, and modify competitive teams of up to six Pokémon. Each team member can be meticulously configured with tournament-level precision, including:

- **Nature selection** for stat optimization
- **Held items** for strategic advantages
- **Ability choices** (including hidden abilities)
- **Custom movesets** with up to four moves
- **IV (Individual Values)** configuration for perfect stats
- **EV (Effort Values)** distribution with real-time stat calculations

The system includes comprehensive account management with secure data persistence, enabling users to maintain multiple team configurations and share builds with the community. This module transforms theoretical team concepts into practical, competition-ready configurations. Persistent storage ensures that carefully crafted teams remain accessible for ongoing refinement and strategic analysis, eliminating the need for repetitive manual entry and supporting iterative team development workflows.
